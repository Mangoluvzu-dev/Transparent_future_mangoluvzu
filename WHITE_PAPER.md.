​1. Abstract
​This paper introduces an 8D cryptographic framework utilizing Octonions and Wolfram’s Euler liquid flow equations. By applying a specific observer constant, we achieve a state of non-associative entropy suitable for transparent privacy.
​2. Core Mathematical Architecture
​The engine relies on three fixed variables to maintain manifold stability:
​The Observer Constant: -0.00065.
​Amplitude Scaling: 1.25.
​Resonance Base (\Omega): Defined by the calculation (-\pi / \sqrt{10}) - 0.99678.
​3. Computational Logic
​The framework integrates Rule 110 for Turing-complete cellular automata and Jordan/Albert algebra to manage non-associative data structures. This ensures that the cryptographic flow is dynamic and resistant to standard associative reverse-engineering.
​4. Glossary of Terms
​Octonion: An 8-dimensional number system that is non-associative.
​Jordan Inversion: The method used to balance high-dimensional manifolds.
​Rule 110: A cellular automaton rule used for universal computation.
