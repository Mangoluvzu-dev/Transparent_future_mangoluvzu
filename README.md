Version: 1.0.0-Stable
​📜 Project Overview
​The 5D Octonion Resonance Engine is an open-source cryptographic framework designed to explore non-associative entropy. By utilizing 8-dimensional Octonion algebra (O), this engine generates complex scalar keys influenced by fluid dynamics and cellular automata.
​🧬 Core Mathematical Constants
​To maintain "Perfect Entropy," the engine is tuned to the following parameters:
​Resonance Base (\Omega): (- \pi / \sqrt{10}) - 0.99678
​Amplitude Scaling: 1.25
​Observer Constant: -0.00065
​🛠 Features
​Octonion Matrix: 8D non-associative key generation.
​Rule 110 Entropy: Turing-complete cellular automata logic.
​Euler Fluid Flow: Simulating non-linear data evolution.
​Mobile Optimized: Fully compatible with Android 13 and Pydroid 3.
​📚 Glossary
​Octonion: An 8D number system where (A \times B) \times C \neq A \times (B \times C).
​Jordan Inversion: The method used to balance high-dimensional manifolds.
​Wolfram Rule 110: The engine's primary source of computational randomness.
